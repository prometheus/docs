# Prometheus Documentation

This repository contains both the content and the static-site generator code for the
Prometheus documentation site.

## Contributing Changes

See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for general instructions for new Prometheus contributors.

The main documentation contents of this website are located in the [`content/docs`](content/docs) directory.

Documentation concerning the Prometheus server is [maintained in the Prometheus server repository](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/tree/master/docs) and cloned into the website at build time.

As a guideline, please keep the documentation generally applicable and avoid use-case-specific changes.

## Prerequisites

You need to have a working Ruby environment set up (including [bundler](https://bundler.io/))
and then install the necessary gems:

```bash
cd docs
make bundle
```

## Building

To generate the static site, run:

```bash
make build
```

The resulting static site will be stored in the `output` directory.

Optionally, you can use an API token to avoid rate limits on the API. You can get an API token from https://github.com/settings/tokens/new.
```bash
export GITHUB_AUTHENTICATION='-u user:token'
```

## Development Server

To run a local server that displays the generated site, run:

```bash
# Rebuild the site whenever relevant files change:
make guard
# Start the local development server in a separate shell:
make serve
```

You should now be able to view the generated site at
[http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000).

## Automatic Deployment

This site is automatically deployed using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

If you have the prerequisite access rights, you can view the Netlify settings here:

* GitHub webhook notifying Netlify of branch changes: https://github.com/prometheus/docs/settings/hooks
* Netlify project: https://app.netlify.com/sites/prometheus-docs

Changes to the `master` branch are deployed to the main site at https://prometheus.io.

Netlify also creates preview deploys for every pull request. To view these for a PR where all checks have passed:

1. In the CI section of the PR, click on "Show all checks".
2. On the "deploy/netlify" entry, click on "Details" to view the preview site for the PR.

You may have to wait a while for the "deploy/netlify" check to appear after creating or updating the PR, even if the other checks have already passed.
