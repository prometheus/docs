It's that time of the year again! With just a few weeks to go until [PromCon EU 2025](https://promcon.io/2025-munich/), the Prometheus community is buzzing with excitement, preparations, and passionate conference-driven development. This tenth iteration of the conference dedicated to the CNCF Prometheus monitoring ecosystem continues the tradition of a cozy, community-led, single-track, 2-day intense Prometheus user and developer learning time!

The conference is taking place on October 21–22 at the Google Office in Munich, with an incredible lineup of talks and discussions you won't want to miss!

## Content Highlights

The schedule is packed with sessions for everyone, from beginners to seasoned veterans. Topics range from:

* Exciting development of Prometheus features and protocols, e.g. OpenMetrics 2.0, downsampling, delta metric, Parquet-based storage.
* Insightful user community case studies and integrations, e.g. agentic AI, OpenTelemetry Schema and Resource Attributes adoption, auto aggregations, operator improvements, Perses novelties and Rust ecosystem updates.
* General best practices and guidelines for navigating complex observability ecosystems, e.g. Prometheus and OpenTelemetry instrumentation, new alerting methodologies, monitoring CPU hardware, and new PromQL aspects.

...and more!

## Live Recordings

The event tickets have been sold out, but fear not! All talks will be live-streamed for free and available as recordings after the event.
