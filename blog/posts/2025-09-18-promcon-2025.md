It's that time of a year again! With just a few weeks to go until [PromCon EU 2025](https://promcon.io/2025-munich/) the Prometheus community is buzzing with excitement, preparations and passionate conference driven development. This tenth iteration of the conference dedicated to the CNCF Prometheus monitoring ecosystem continues the tradition of a cosy, community led, single track, 2 days of intense Prometheus user and developer learnings!

The conference is back in Google Office in Munich, taking place on October 21-22 with the incredible lineup of talks and discussions you won't want to miss!

## Content Highlights

The schedule is packed with sessions for everyone, from beginners to seasoned veterans. Topics range from:

* Exciting current and future developments of Prometheus protocols, features and storages (e.g. OpenMetrics 2.0, downsampling, delta metric support, Parquet-based storage)
* Amazing user community case studies and integrations (e.g. OpenTelemetry Schema and resource attributes adoption, auto aggregations, operator, Perses, Rust, AI MCP integrations )
* General best practices and guides for navigating complex observability aspects (e.g. Prometheus and OpenTelemetry instrumentation, new alerting methodologies, monitoring CPU hardware, PromQL intro)

...and more!

## Last Tickets and Live Recordings

A few last tickets are still available, but they will likely sell quickly soon. You can register for the conference here: <https://promcon.io/2025-munich/register/>.

However, if you can't make it to Munich, fear not! All talks will be live-streamed and available as recordings after the event. Keep an eye on the official PromCon website and social media channels for updates.

## For in Person Attendees: Lightning Talks
