  If you are having a problem using Prometheus, there are several ways to get
  help from the community.
  </p>
  <h2>Documentation</h2>
  <p>The <a href="/docs/introduction/overview/">official documentation</a> for
  Prometheus is extensive, and covers the core system in depth.</p>

  <h2>IRC</h2>
  <p>IRC is good for getting interactive help. As our users are spread around the world, please be patient and hang around
  for a while if you do not get an immediate answer.</p>
 
  <p>We are on <code>#prometheus</code> on <a href="http://freenode.net/">irc.freenode.net</a>. If you do not have an IRC
  client, you can use <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?randomnick=1&channels=%23prometheus&prompt=1&uio=d4">Webchat</a>
  from your browser.</p>

  <h2>Mailing List</h2>
  <p>
