    <p>
      We host public weekly meetings focused on Prometheus development and
      contributions. It’s meant for developers and maintainers to meet and get
      unblocked, pair review, and discuss development aspects of the Prometheus
      and related official projects (e.g node_exporter, alertmanager). The
      document linked below contains all the details, including how to
      register.

    <h1>Developer summits</h1>
    <p>
      Developer summits are public meetings to discuss more involved
      development topics. They currently happen monthly as an online
      meeting. (For details, check out the public events calendar
      linked in the Community section above.) The Prometheus team
      curates the agenda based on recent discussions via other
      channels. To propose a topic, please send a mail to the
      <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/prometheus-developers">development mailing list</a>
      at least 24 hours prior to the summit.
    </p>
    <p>
      As of 2024, we carry a public <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uurQCi5iVufhYHGlBZ8mJMK_freDFKPG0iYBQqJ9fvA">rolling meeting notes document</a>. You can find our historic meeting notes below.

    <h2>Developer Summit's Facilitator</h2>
    <p>
      The Facilitator role was created to help the Prometheus team to run the Developer Summits effectively. It's a rotational role (switches for every meeting) and its responsibilities are spread across different phases of the summit:
    </p>
    <h3>Before the summit</h3>
    <p>
      Before the summit, the Facilitator's main goal is to help the Prometheus team define the agenda and the topics to be discussed while making sure interested parties of the most voted topics will be able to attend the summit. We suggest the following tasks:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Two or three days before the meeting, send reminders in our public community channels inviting people to add Agenda Topics, and Prometheus Team members and maintainers to vote on topics they'd like to discuss.</li>
      <li>One day before the meeting, reach out to "Topic owners" who received the most votes to make sure they'll make it to the summit.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>During the summit</h3>
    <p>
      During the summit, the Facilitator is here to make sure the meeting runs smoothly, and that consensus is reached when needed. We suggest the following tasks:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Start the meeting on time. Use @prometheus.io account for the admin meeting permissions.</li>
      <li>Start the recording and mention that the Code of Conduct applies.</li>
      <li>Select topics to be discussed based on votes and who is currently present in the meeting.</li>
      <li>Take notes or find volunteer for taking notes in the shared document.</li>
      <li>Strategically step in when the discussion is not moving forward or deviating from the topic.</li>
      <li>Call for consensus when needed.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>After the summit</h3>
    <p>
      Once the meeting is over, the last task of the Facilitator is to find a new Facilitator for the next summit by sending an email to the Prometheus Team mailing list.
    </p>

    <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
    <p>
      To make Prometheus a welcoming and harassment-free experience for everyone, we follow the
      <a href="https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md">CNCF Code of Conduct</a>.
    </p>

    <h1>Legal Umbrella</h1>
    <p>
      Prometheus is an independent open-source project and not controlled by
      any single company. To emphasize this we joined the
      <a href="https://cncf.io/">Cloud Native Computing Foundation</a> in 2016 as the second project after <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>.
