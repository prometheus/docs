Have you ever selected the top 10 time series for something, but instead of 10 you got 100? If yes, this one is for you. Let me walk you through what the underlying problem is and how I fixed it.

Currently, the `topk()` query only makes sense as an instant query where you get exactly `k` results, but when you run it as a range query, you can get much more than `k` results since every step is evaluated independently. This `@` modifier lets you fix the ranking for all the steps in a range query.

In Prometheus v2.25.0, we have introduced a new PromQL modifier `@`. Similar to how `offset` modifier lets you offset the evaluation of vector selector, range vector selector, and subqueries by a fixed duration relative to the evaluation time, the `@` modifier lets you fix the evaluation for those selectors irrespective of the query evaluation time. The credits for this syntax goes to [Bj√∂rn Rabenstein](https://github.com/beorn7/).

    <vector-selector> @ <timestamp>
    <range-vector-selector> @ <timestamp>
    <subquery> @ <timestamp>

The `<timestamp>` is a unix timestamp and described with a float literal.

For example, the query `http_requests_total @ 1609746000` returns the value of `http_requests_total` at `2021-01-04T07:40:00+00:00`. The query `rate(http_requests_total[5m] @ 1609746000)` returns the 5-minute rate of `http_requests_total` at the same time.

Additionally, `start()` and `end()` can also be used as values for the `@` modifier as special values. For a range query, they resolve to the start and end of the range query respectively and remain the same for all steps. For an instant query, `start()` and `end()` both resolve to the evaluation time.

Coming back to the `topk()` fix, the following query plots the `1m` rate of `http_requests_total` of those series whose last `1h` rate was among the top 5. Hence now you can make sense of the `topk()` even as a range query where it plots exactly `k` results.

    rate(http_requests_total[1m]) # This acts like the actual selector.
      and
    topk(5, rate(http_requests_total[1h] @ end())) # This acts like a ranking function which filters the selector.

Similarly, the `topk()` ranking can be replaced with other functions like `histogram_quantile()` which only makes sense as an instant query right now. `rate()` can be replaced with `<aggregation>_over_time()`, etc. Let us know how you use this new modifier!

`@` modifier is disabled by default and can be enabled using the flag `--enable-feature=promql-at-modifier`.
