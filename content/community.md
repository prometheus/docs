Training](/support-training) page.*

# Contributing

We welcome community contributions! Please see the `CONTRIBUTING.md`
file in the respective Prometheus repository for instructions on how to
submit changes. If you are planning on making more elaborate or
potentially controversial changes, please discuss them in the developers
IRC channel or on the mailing list before sending a pull request.

We host public weekly meetings focused on Prometheus development and
contributions. It's meant for developers and maintainers to meet and get
unblocked, pair review, and discuss development aspects of the
Prometheus and related official projects (e.g `node_exporter`,
`alertmanager`). The document linked below contains all the details,
including how to register.

# Developer summits

Developer summits are public meetings to discuss more involved
development topics. They currently happen monthly as an online meeting.
(For details, check out the public events calendar linked in the
Community section above.) The Prometheus team curates the agenda based
on recent discussions via other channels. To propose a topic, please
send a mail to the [development mailing
list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/prometheus-developers) at
least 24 hours prior to the summit.

As of 2024, we carry a public [rolling meeting notes
document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uurQCi5iVufhYHGlBZ8mJMK_freDFKPG0iYBQqJ9fvA).

## Developer Summit's Facilitator

The Facilitator role was created to help the Prometheus team to run the
Developer Summits effectively. It's a rotational role (switches for
every meeting) and its responsibilities are spread across different
phases of the summit:

### Before the summit

Before the summit, the Facilitator's main goal is to help the
Prometheus team define the agenda and the topics to be discussed while
making sure interested parties of the most voted topics will be able to
attend the summit. We suggest the following tasks:

- Two or three days before the meeting, send reminders in our public
  community channels inviting people to add Agenda Topics, and
  Prometheus Team members and maintainers to vote on topics they'd
  like to discuss.
- One day before the meeting, reach out to "Topic owners" who
  received the most votes to make sure they'll make it to the summit.

### During the summit

During the summit, the Facilitator is here to make sure the meeting runs
smoothly, and that consensus is reached when needed. We suggest the
following tasks:

- Start the meeting on time. Use `@prometheus.io` account for the admin meeting permissions.
- Start the recording and mention that the Code of Conduct applies.
- Select topics to be discussed based on votes and who is currently present in the meeting.
- Take notes or find volunteer for taking notes in the shared document.
- Strategically step in when the discussion is not moving forward or deviating from the topic.
- Call for consensus when needed.

### After the summit

Once the meeting is over, the last task of the Facilitator is to find a
new Facilitator for the next summit by sending an email to the
Prometheus Team mailing list.

# Code of Conduct

To make Prometheus a welcoming and harassment-free experience for
everyone, we follow the [CNCF Code of
Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md).

# Legal Umbrella

Prometheus is an independent open-source project and not controlled by
any single company. To emphasize this we joined the [Cloud Native
Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io/) in 2016 as the second project
after [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/).
