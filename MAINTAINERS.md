Documentation that refers to a specific project within the Prometheus ecosystem
is maintained by the maintainers of the respective project. For example, refer
to the maintainers specified in Alertmanager's
[MAINTAINERS.md](https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md)
file for documentation about the Alertmanager.

Note that the documentation for the Prometheus server is located in the
[prometheus/prometheus
repository](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/tree/main/docs) itself.

For anything that is not documentation for a specific project, refer to the
following maintainers with their focus areas:

* Julius Volz <julius.volz@gmail.com> @juliusv: Web design, static site
  generator.
* Richard Hartmann <richih@richih.org> @RichiH: Everything
  else.
