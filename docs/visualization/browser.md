The expression browser is available at `/graph` on the Prometheus server, allowing you
to enter any expression and see its result either in a table or graphed over time.

This is primarily useful for ad-hoc queries and debugging. For graphs, use
[Grafana](/docs/visualization/grafana/) or [Console templates](/docs/visualization/consoles/).
