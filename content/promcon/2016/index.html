        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          PromCon 2016 will be the first conference around the Prometheus
          monitoring system. It will take place from August 25 - 26 at Google
          Berlin, and will provide space for 80 attendants.
        </p>
        <p>
          PromCon aims to connect Prometheus users and developers from around
          the world in order to exchange knowledge, best practices, and
          experience gained around using Prometheus. We also want to
          collaborate to build a community and grow professional connections
          around systems and service monitoring.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are looking forward to seeing you at PromCon 2016!
        </p>

        <h2>Submit a talk</h2>
        <p>
          The PromCon Call for Papers (CFP) is open for talk submissions until
          April 30, 2016, and we encourage you to submit a talk!

        </p>
        <p>
          We are accepting talk proposals around the following topics, with
          experience levels ranging from beginner to expert:
        </p>
        <p>
          <ul>

          <b>Speaker reimbursements:</b> Since PromCon is a non-commercial
          community conference, we will likely not be able to reimburse speakers
          for travel and accommodation. If you want to give a talk but cannot
          get reimbursed by your company, please submit a proposal anyways and
          let us know in the "Additional note to the selection committee" field.
          We will then see what we can do, depending on available funding.
        </p>

        <h2>Become a sponsor</h2>
        <p>
          As a community conference with a minimal entrance fee, we will depend
          on sponsors for making PromCon possible. We will especially need to
          cover the following expenses:
        </p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Professional video recordings of all talks</li>
            <li>Catering for 80 attendants</li>
            <li>An evening after-party</li>
            <li>Printed materials, banners, lanyards, etc.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Do you want to help make this happen and <b>get your company featured
          in videos, banners, and printed materials?</b> Please register to be
