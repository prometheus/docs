We have structured our considerations for developing and working with Promethues
into four groups in decreasing order of importance, and likelihood to change.

1. Philosophy
2. Goals and Non-Goals
3. Design decisions
4. Patterns and Anti-Patterns

While we are not implying that anything in this section is likely to change at
all, it's still more likely for us to change a particular pattern over time than
the underlying philosophy.
