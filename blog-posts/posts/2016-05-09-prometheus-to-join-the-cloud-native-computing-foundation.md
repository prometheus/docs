Since the inception of Prometheus, we have been looking for a sustainable
governance model for the project that is independent of any single company.
Recently, we have been in discussions with the newly formed [Cloud Native
Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io/) (CNCF), which is backed by Google,
CoreOS, Docker, Weaveworks, Mesosphere, and [other leading infrastructure
companies](https://cncf.io/about/members).

Today, we are excited to announce that the CNCF's Technical Oversight Committee
[voted unanimously](http://lists.cncf.io/pipermail/cncf-toc/2016-May/000198.html) to
accept Prometheus as a second hosted project after Kubernetes! You can find
more information about these plans in the
[official press release by the CNCF](https://cncf.io/news/news/2016/05/cloud-native-computing-foundation-accepts-prometheus-second-hosted-project).

By joining the CNCF, we hope to establish a clear and sustainable project
governance model, as well as benefit from the resources, infrastructure, and
advice that the independent foundation provides to its members.

We think that the CNCF and Prometheus are an ideal thematic match, as both
focus on bringing about a modern vision of the cloud.

In the following months, we will be working with the CNCF on finalizing the
project governance structure. We will report back when there are more details
to announce.
