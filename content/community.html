    <h1>Project Governance</h1>
    <p>
      Prometheus is an independent open-source project and not controlled by
      any single company.  To emphasize this and clarify our governance
      structure, we joined the
      <a href="https://cncf.io/">Cloud Native Computing Foundation</a> in 2016.
