# Writing exporters

If you are instrumenting your own code, the [general rules of how to
instrument code with a Prometheus client
library](/docs/practices/instrumentation/) should be followed. When
taking metrics from another monitoring or instrumentation system, things
tend not to be so black and white.

This document contains things you should consider when writing an
exporter or custom collector. The theory covered will also be of
interest to those doing direct instrumentation.

If you are writing an exporter and are unclear on anything here, please
contact us on IRC (#prometheus on Freenode) or the [mailing
list](/community).

## Maintainability and purity

The main decision you need to make when writing an exporter is how much
work you’re willing to put in to get perfect metrics out of it.

If the system in question has only a handful of metrics that rarely
change, then getting everything perfect is an easy choice, a good
example of this is the [HAProxy
exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/haproxy_exporter).

On the other hand, if you try to get things perfect when the system has
hundreds of metrics that change frequently with new versions, then
you’ve signed yourself up for a lot of ongoing work. The [MySQL
exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/mysqld_exporter) is on this end
of the spectrum.

The [node exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter) is a
mix of these, with complexity varying by module. For example, the
`mdadm` collector hand-parses a file and exposes metrics created
specifically for that collector, so we may as well get the metrics
right. For the `meminfo` collector the results vary across kernel
versions so we end up doing just enough of a transform to create valid
metrics.

## Configuration

When working with applications, you should aim for an exporter that
requires no custom configuration by the user beyond telling it where the
application is.  You may also need to offer the ability to filter out
certain metrics if they may be too granular and expensive on large
setups, for example the [HAProxy
exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/haproxy_exporter) allows
filtering of per-server stats. Similarly, there may be expensive metrics
that are disabled by default.

When working with other monitoring systems, frameworks and protocols you
will often need to provide additional configuration or customization to
generate metrics suitable for Prometheus. In the best case scenario, a
monitoring system has a similar enough data model to Prometheus that you
can automatically determine how to transform metrics. This is the case
for [Cloudwatch](https://github.com/prometheus/cloudwatch_exporter),
[SNMP](https://github.com/prometheus/snmp_exporter) and
[collectd](https://github.com/prometheus/collectd_exporter). At most, we
need the ability to let the user select which metrics they want to pull
out.

In other cases, metrics from the system are completely non-standard,
depending on the usage of the system and the underlying application.  In
that case the user has to tell us how to transform the metrics. The [JMX
exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/jmx_exporter) is the worst
offender here, with the
[Graphite](https://github.com/prometheus/graphite_exporter) and
[StatsD](https://github.com/prometheus/statsd_exporter) exporters also
requiring configuration to extract labels.

Ensuring the exporter works out of the box without configuration, and
providing a selection of example configurations for transformation if
required, is advised.

YAML is the standard Prometheus configuration format, all configuration
should use YAML by default.

## Metrics

### Naming

Follow the [best practices on metric naming](/docs/practices/naming).

Generally metric names should allow someone who is familiar with
Prometheus but not a particular system to make a good guess as to what a
metric means.  A metric named `http_requests_total` is not extremely
useful - are these being measured as they come in, in some filter or
when they get to the user’s code?  And `requests_total` is even worse,
what type of requests?

With direct instrumentation, a given metric should exist within exactly
one file. Accordingly, within exporters and collectors, a metric should
apply to exactly one subsystem and be named accordingly.

Metric names should never be procedurally generated, except when writing
a custom collector or exporter.

Metric names for applications should generally be prefixed by the
exporter name, e.g. `haproxy_up`.

Metrics must use base units (e.g. seconds, bytes) and leave converting
them to something more readable to graphing tools. No matter what units
you end up using, the units in the metric name must match the units in
use. Similarly, expose ratios, not percentages. Even better, specify a
counter for each of the two components of the ratio.

Metric names should not include the labels that they’re exported with,
e.g. `by_type`, as that won’t make sense if the label is aggregated
away.

The one exception is when you’re exporting the same data with different
labels via multiple metrics, in which case that’s usually the sanest way
to distinguish them. For direct instrumentation, this should only come
up when exporting a single metric with all the labels would have too
high a cardinality.

Prometheus metrics and label names are written in `snake_case`.
Converting `camelCase` to `snake_case` is desirable, though doing so
automatically doesn’t always produce nice results for things like
`myTCPExample` or `isNaN` so sometimes it’s best to leave them as-is.

Exposed metrics should not contain colons, these are reserved for user
defined recording rules to use when aggregating.

Only `[a-zA-Z0-9:_]` are valid in metric names, any other characters
should be sanitized to an underscore.

The `_sum`, `_count`, `_bucket` and `_total` suffixes are used by
Summaries, Histograms and Counters. Unless you’re producing one of
those, avoid these suffixes.

`_total` is a convention for counters, you should use it if you’re using
the COUNTER type.

The `process_` and `scrape_` prefixes are reserved. It’s okay to add
your own prefix on to these if they follow the [matching
semantics](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q0MXWdwp1mdXCzNRak6bW5LLVylVRXhdi7_21Sg15xQ/edit).
For example, Prometheus has `scrape_duration_seconds` for how long a
scrape took, it's good practice to also have an exporter-centric metric,
e.g. `jmx_scrape_duration_seconds`, saying how long the specific
exporter took to do its thing. For process stats where you have access
to the PID, both Go and Python offer collectors that’ll handle this for
you. A good example of this is the [HAProxy
exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/haproxy_exporter).

When you have a successful request count and a failed request count, the
best way to expose this is as one metric for total requests and another
metric for failed requests. This makes it easy to calculate the failure
ratio. Do not use one metric with a failed or success label. Similarly,
with hit or miss for caches, it’s better to have one metric for total and
another for hits.

Consider the likelihood that someone using monitoring will do a code or
web search for the metric name. If the names are very well-established
and unlikely to be used outside of the realm of people used to those
names, for example SNMP and network engineers, then leaving them as-is
may be a good idea. This logic doesn’t apply for all exporters, for
example the MySQL exporter metrics may be used by a variety of people,
not just DBAs. A `HELP` string with the original name can provide most
of the same benefits as using the original names.

### Labels

Read the [general
advice](/docs/practices/instrumentation/#things-to-watch-out-for) on
labels.

Avoid `type` as a label name, it’s too generic and often meaningless.
You should also try where possible to avoid names that are likely to
clash with target labels, such as `region`, `zone`, `cluster`,
`availability_zone`, `az`, `datacenter`, `dc`, `owner`, `customer`,
`stage`, `service`, `environment` and `env`. If, however, that’s what
the application calls some resource, it’s best not to cause confusion by
renaming it.

Avoid the temptation to put things into one metric just because they
share a prefix. Unless you’re sure something makes sense as one metric,
multiple metrics is safer.

The label `le` has special meaning for Histograms, and `quantile` for
Summaries. Avoid these labels generally.

Read/write and send/receive are best as separate metrics, rather than as
a label. This is usually because you care about only one of them at a
time, and it is easier to use them that way.

The rule of thumb is that one metric should make sense when summed or
averaged.  There is one other case that comes up with exporters, and
that’s where the data is fundamentally tabular and doing otherwise would
require users to do regexes on metric names to be usable. Consider the
voltage sensors on your motherboard, while doing math across them is
meaningless, it makes sense to have them in one metric rather than
having one metric per sensor. All values within a metric should
(almost) always have the same unit, for example consider if fan speeds
were mixed in with the voltages, and you had no way to automatically
separate them.

Don’t do this:

<pre>
my_metric{label=a} 1
my_metric{label=b} 6
<b>my_metric{label=total} 7</b>
</pre>

or this:

<pre>
my_metric{label=a} 1
my_metric{label=b} 6
<b>my_metric{} 7</b>
</pre>

The former breaks for people who do a `sum()` over your metric, and the
latter breaks sum and is quite difficult to work with. Some client
libraries, for example Go, will actively try to stop you doing the
latter in a custom collector, and all client libraries should stop you
from doing the latter with direct instrumentation. Never do either of
these, rely on Prometheus aggregation instead.

If your monitoring exposes a total like this, drop the total. If you
have to keep it around for some reason, for example the total includes
things not counted individually, use different metric names.

Instrumentation labels should be minimal, every extra label is one more
that users need to consider when writing their PromQL. Accordingly,
avoid having instrumentation labels which could be removed without
affecting the uniqueness of the time series. Additional information
around a metric can be added via an info metric, for an example see
below how to handle version numbers.

However, there are cases where it is expected that virtually all users of
a metric will want the additional information. If so, adding a
non-unique label, rather than an info metric, is the right solution. For
example the
[mysqld_exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/mysqld_exporter)'s
`mysqld_perf_schema_events_statements_total`'s `digest` label is a hash
of the full query pattern and is sufficient for uniqueness. However, it
is of little use without the human readable `digest_text` label, which
for long queries will contain only the start of the query pattern and is
thus not unique. Thus we end up with both the `digest_text` label for
humans and the `digest` label for uniqueness.

### Target labels, not static scraped labels

If you ever find yourself wanting to apply the same label to all of your
metrics, stop.

There’s generally two cases where this comes up.

The first is for some label it would be useful to have on the metrics
such as the version number of the software. Instead, use the approach
described at
[https://www.robustperception.io/how-to-have-labels-for-machine-roles/](http://www.robustperception.io/how-to-have-labels-for-machine-roles/).

The second case is when a label is really a target label. These are
things like region, cluster names, and so on, that come from your
infrastructure setup rather than the application itself. It’s not for an
application to say where it fits in your label taxonomy, that’s for the
person running the Prometheus server to configure and different people
monitoring the same application may give it different names.

Accordingly, these labels belong up in the scrape configs of Prometheus
via whatever service discovery you’re using. It’s okay to apply the
concept of machine roles here as well, as it’s likely useful information
for at least some people scraping it.

### Types

You should try to match up the types of your metrics to Prometheus
types. This usually means counters and gauges. The `_count` and `_sum`
of summaries are also relatively common, and on occasion you’ll see
quantiles. Histograms are rare, if you come across one remember that the
exposition format exposes cumulative values.

Often it won’t be obvious what the type of metric is, especially if
you’re automatically processing a set of metrics. In general `UNTYPED`
is a safe default.

Counters can’t go down, so if you have a counter type coming from
another instrumentation system that can be decremented, for example
Dropwizard metrics then it's not a counter, it's a gauge. `UNTYPED` is
probably the best type to use there, as `GAUGE` would be misleading if
it were being used as a counter.

### Help strings

When you’re transforming metrics it’s useful for users to be able to
track back to what the original was, and what rules were in play that
caused that transformation. Putting in the name of the
collector or exporter, the ID of any rule that was applied and the
name and details of the original metric into the help string will greatly
aid users.

Prometheus doesn’t like one metric having different help strings. If
you’re making one metric from many others, choose one of them to put in
the help string.

For examples of this, the SNMP exporter uses the OID and the JMX
exporter puts in a sample mBean name. The [HAProxy
exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/haproxy_exporter) has
hand-written strings. The [node
exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter) also has a wide
variety of examples.

### Drop less useful statistics

Some instrumentation systems expose 1m, 5m, 15m rates, average rates since
application start (these are called `mean` in Dropwizard metrics for
example) in addition to minimums, maximums and standard deviations.

These should all be dropped, as they’re not very useful and add clutter.
Prometheus can calculate rates itself, and usually more accurately as
the averages exposed are usually exponentially decaying. You don’t know
what time the min or max were calculated over, and the standard deviation
is statistically useless and you can always expose sum of squares,
`_sum` and `_count` if you ever need to calculate it.

Quantiles have related issues, you may choose to drop them or put them
in a Summary.

### Dotted strings

Many monitoring systems don’t have labels, instead doing things like
`my.class.path.mymetric.labelvalue1.labelvalue2.labelvalue3`.

The [Graphite](https://github.com/prometheus/graphite_exporter) and
[StatsD](https://github.com/prometheus/statsd_exporter) exporters share
a way of transforming these with a small configuration language. Other
exporters should implement the same. The transformation is currently
implemented only in Go, and would benefit from being factored out into a
separate library.

## Collectors

When implementing the collector for your exporter, you should never use
the usual direct instrumentation approach and then update the metrics on
each scrape.

Rather create new metrics each time. In Go this is done with
[MustNewConstMetric](https://godoc.org/github.com/prometheus/client_golang/prometheus#MustNewConstMetric)
in your `Collect()` method. For Python see
[https://github.com/prometheus/client_python#custom-collectors](https://github.com/prometheus/client_python#custom-collectors)
and for Java generate a `List<MetricFamilySamples>` in your collect
method, see
[StandardExports.java](https://github.com/prometheus/client_java/blob/master/simpleclient_hotspot/src/main/java/io/prometheus/client/hotspot/StandardExports.java)
for an example.

The reason for this is two-fold. Firstly, two scrapes could happen at
the same time, and direct instrumentation uses what are effectively
file-level global variables, so you’ll get race conditions. Secondly, if
a label value disappears, it’ll still be exported.

Instrumenting your exporter itself via direct instrumentation is fine,
e.g. total bytes transferred or calls performed by the exporter across
all scrapes.  For exporters such as the [blackbox
exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/blackbox_exporter) and [SMNP
exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/snmp_exporter), which aren’t
tied to a single target, these should only be exposed on a vanilla
`/metrics` call, not on a scrape of a particular target.

### Metrics about the scrape itself

Sometimes you’d like to export metrics that are about the scrape, like
how long it took or how many records you processed.

These should be exposed as gauges as they’re about an event, the scrape,
and the metric name prefixed by the exporter name, for example
`jmx_scrape_duration_seconds`. Usually the `_exporter` is excluded and
if the exporter also makes sense to use as just a collector, then
definitely exclude it.

### Machine and process metrics

Many systems, for example Elasticsearch, expose machine metrics such as
CPU, memory and filesystem information. As the [node
exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter) provides these in
the Prometheus ecosystem, such metrics should be dropped.

In the Java world, many instrumentation frameworks expose process-level
and JVM-level stats such as CPU and GC. The Java client and JMX exporter
already include these in the preferred form via
[DefaultExports.java](https://github.com/prometheus/client_java/blob/master/simpleclient_hotspot/src/main/java/io/prometheus/client/hotspot/DefaultExports.java),
so these should also be dropped.

Similarly with other languages and frameworks.

## Deployment

Each exporter should monitor exactly one instance application,
preferably sitting right beside it on the same machine. That means for
every HAProxy you run, you run a `haproxy_exporter` process. For every
machine with a Mesos worker, you run the [Mesos
exporter](https://github.com/mesosphere/mesos_exporter) on it, and
another one for the master, if a machine has both.

The theory behind this is that for direct instrumentation this is what
you’d be doing, and we’re trying to get as close to that as we can in
other layouts.  This means that all service discovery is done in
Prometheus, not in exporters.  This also has the benefit that Prometheus
has the target information it needs to allow users probe your service
with the [blackbox
exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/blackbox_exporter).

There are two exceptions:

The first is where running beside the application you are monitoring is
completely nonsensical. The SNMP, blackbox and IPMI exporters are the
main examples of this. The IPMI and SNMP exporters as the devices are
often black boxes that it’s impossible to run code on (though if you
could run a node exporter on them instead that’d be better), and the
blackbox exporter where you’re monitoring something like a DNS name,
where there’s also nothing to run on. In this case, Prometheus should
still do service discovery, and pass on the target to be scraped. See
the blackbox and SNMP exporters for examples.

Note that it is only currently possible to write this type of exporter
with the Go, Python and Java client libraries.

The second exception is where you’re pulling some stats out of a random
instance of a system and don’t care which one you’re talking to.
Consider a set of MySQL replicas you wanted to run some business queries
against the data to then export. Having an exporter that uses your usual
load balancing approach to talk to one replica is the sanest approach.

This doesn’t apply when you’re monitoring a system with master-election,
in that case you should monitor each instance individually and deal with
the "masterness" in Prometheus. This is as there isn’t always exactly
one master, and changing what a target is underneath Prometheus’s feet
will cause oddities.

### Scheduling

Metrics should only be pulled from the application when Prometheus
scrapes them, exporters should not perform scrapes based on their own
timers. That is, all scrapes should be synchronous.

Accordingly, you should not set timestamps on the metrics you expose, let
Prometheus take care of that. If you think you need timestamps, then you
probably need the
[Pushgateway](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/pushing/)
instead.

If a metric is particularly expensive to retrieve, i.e. takes more than
a minute, it is acceptable to cache it. This should be noted in the
`HELP` string.

The default scrape timeout for Prometheus is 10 seconds. If your
exporter can be expected to exceed this, you should explicitly call this
out in your user documentation.

### Pushes

Some applications and monitoring systems only push metrics, for example
StatsD, Graphite and collectd.

There are two considerations here.

Firstly, when do you expire metrics? Collectd and things talking to
Graphite both export regularly, and when they stop we want to stop
exposing the metrics.  Collectd includes an expiry time so we use that,
Graphite doesn’t so it is a flag on the exporter.

StatsD is a bit different, as it is dealing with events rather than
metrics. The best model is to run one exporter beside each application
and restart them when the application restarts so that the state is
cleared.

Secondly, these sort of systems tend to allow your users to send either
deltas or raw counters. You should rely on the raw counters as far as
possible, as that’s the general Prometheus model.

For service-level metrics, e.g. service-level batch jobs, you should
have your exporter push into the Pushgateway and exit after the event
rather than handling the state yourself. For instance-level batch
metrics, there is no clear pattern yet. The options are either to abuse
the node exporter’s textfile collector, rely on in-memory state
(probably best if you don’t need to persist over a reboot) or implement
similar functionality to the textfile collector.

### Failed scrapes

There are currently two patterns for failed scrapes where the
application you’re talking to doesn’t respond or has other problems.

The first is to return a 5xx error.

The second is to have a `myexporter_up`, e.g. `haproxy_up`, variable
that has a value of 0 or 1 depending on whether the scrape worked.

The latter is better where there’s still some useful metrics you can get
even with a failed scrape, such as the HAProxy exporter providing
process stats. The former is a tad easier for users to deal with, as
`up` works in the usual way, although you can’t distinguish between the
exporter being down and the application being down.

### Landing page

It’s nicer for users if visiting `http://yourexporter/` has a simple
HTML page with the name of the exporter, and a link to the `/metrics`
page.

### Port numbers

A user may have many exporters and Prometheus components on the same
machine, so to make that easier each has a unique port number.

[https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/wiki/Default-port-allocations](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/wiki/Default-port-allocations)
is where we track them, this is publicly editable.

Feel free to grab the next free port number when developing your
exporter, preferably before publicly announcing it. If you’re not ready
to release yet, putting your username and WIP is fine.

This is a registry to make our users’ lives a little easier, not a
commitment to develop particular exporters. For exporters for internal
applications we recommend using ports outside of the range of default
port allocations.

## Announcing

Once you’re ready to announce your exporter to the world, email the
mailing list and send a PR to add it to [the list of available
exporters](https://github.com/prometheus/docs/blob/master/content/docs/instrumenting/exporters.md).
