# Contributing

Prometheus uses GitHub to manage reviews of pull requests.

* Every commit *MUST* be signed off to agree to the [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/). [How does it work?](https://github.com/dcoapp/app#how-it-works)
** There is a [browser extension](https://github.com/scottrigby/dco-gh-ui) if you're making edits
   from the GitHub UI.

* If you have a trivial fix or improvement, go ahead and create a pull request,
  addressing (with `@...`) the maintainer of this repository (see
  [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md)) in the description of the pull request.

* If you plan to do something more involved, first discuss your ideas
  on our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/prometheus-developers).
  This will avoid unnecessary work and surely give you and us a good deal
  of inspiration.
