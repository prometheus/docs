    <h1>Community</h1>
    <p>
      Prometheus is developed in the open. Here are some of the channels we use
      to communicate and contribute:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>IRC:</strong>
      <a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#prometheus"><code>#prometheus</code></a> on <a href="http://freenode.net/">irc.freenode.net</a>
      (for the easiest start, <a href="https://riot.im/app/#/room/#freenode_#prometheus:matrix.org">join via Riot</a>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>User mailing lists:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/prometheus-announce">prometheus-announce</a> – low-traffic list for announcements like new releases.</li>
        <li><a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/prometheus-users">prometheus-users</a> – for discussions around Prometheus usage and community support. Announcements are <em>not</em> generally mirrored from <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/prometheus-announce">prometheus-announce</a>.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Twitter:</strong>
      <a href="https://twitter.com/PrometheusIO">@PrometheusIO</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Issue tracker:</strong> Use the GitHub issue tracker
      for the various <a href="http://github.com/prometheus">Prometheus
      repositories</a> to file bugs and features request.
      If you need support, please send your questions to the
      <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/prometheus-users">prometheus-users</a>
      mailing list rather than filing a GitHub issue.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Please do not ask individual project members for
      support. Use the channels above instead, where the whole
      community can help you and benefit from the solutions
      provided. If community support is insufficient for your
      situation, please refer to the Commercial Support section
      below.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      We welcome community contributions! Please see the
      <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code> file in the respective Prometheus
      repository for instructions on how to submit changes. If you are

      changes, please discuss them in the developers IRC channel or on
      the mailing list before sending a pull request.

    </p>

    <h1>Developer summits</h1>
    <p>
      We strive to be as open and public as possible. Technical discussions happen on the development list, our in-person meeting notes are public, and we have public calls. Below, you can find links to our developer summits at PromCon 2017 & 2018, respectively. These developer summits are open to join upon request as long as we have capacity. Preference is given to friendly projects and companies, plus diversity. Attendees are free not to be listed in the public meeting notes.

    <h1>Project Governance</h1>
    <p>
      Prometheus is an independent open-source project and not controlled by
      any single company. To emphasize this we joined the
      <a href="https://cncf.io/">Cloud Native Computing Foundation</a> in 2016.

    <a href="https://cncf.io/"><img class="orig-size" src="/assets/cncf_logo.png"></a>
    <p>
      Within the project, we make decisions based on <a href="/governance/">these rules</a>.
    </p>

    <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
    <p>
      To make Prometheus a welcoming and harassment-free experience for everyone, we follow the
      <a href="https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md">CNCF Code of Conduct</a>.
    </p>
