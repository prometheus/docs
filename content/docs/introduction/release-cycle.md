# Long Term Support

Prometheus LTS are selected releases of Prometheus that receive bugfixes for an
extended period of time.

Every 6 weeks, a new Prometheus minor release cycle begins. After those 6
weeks, minor releases generally no longer receive bugfixes. If a user is
impacted by a bug in a minor release, they often need to upgrade to the
latest Prometheus release.

Upgrading Prometheus should be straightforward thanks to our [API stability
guarantees][stab]. However,
there is a risk that new features and enhancements could also bring regressions,
requiring another upgrade.

Prometheus LTS only receive bug, security, and documentation fixes, but over a
time window of one year. The build toolchain will also be kept up-to-date. This
allows companies that rely on Prometheus to limit the upgrade risks while still
having a Prometheus server maintained by the community.
